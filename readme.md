# Campaign Organiser

This, slightly over-the-top named project, is a product of immediate need. It parses `*.md` files and displays them in simple CSS formatting.

## Usage

Place your `*.md` files in `data/` directory and they will be accessible as pages. `index.md` will act as page index.

## Development

At the moment, it is hardcoded for my current RPG campaign. The intent is to make it a bit more generic.
